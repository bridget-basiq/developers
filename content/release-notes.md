<release-note title="2.33.1 - Predictive Availability Module" date="17-11-2020">

This week we extended our station data by including historical station availability. Not every station includes this information at the moment but this will increase over time. 

The predictive availability module contains this week's predictions. For every hour, there is an availability scale ranging from 1 to 5.
