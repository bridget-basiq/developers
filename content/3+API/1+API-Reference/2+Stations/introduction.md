# Charging stations
The Chargetrip station database is [OCPI 2.2]() compliant and must be populated with station data before any routes can be planned. This will be either your own station data or station data from one of many database providers like Hubject, Gireve, EcoMovement, NZTA or Nobil. Our Playground and any of your own applications are populated with freely available European station data from OCM so you can try planning routes across Europe.

## Database options
If you do not have a commercial agreement in place with a charge station provider we can pre-load your account with either free station data from OCM or premium station data from Eco-Movement. Our premium station data exposed over 100.000 highly curated charge stations across Europe including real-time availability, pricing<sup>1</sup>, and predicted availability<sup>1</sup>. You no longer need to connect several costly charge station database providers to get European coverage. See eco-movement.com/ for more details about regional limitations. Contact us for pricing.
