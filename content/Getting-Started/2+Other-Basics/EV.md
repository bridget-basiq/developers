# Introduction on Electric Vehicles
Calculating routes for Electric Vehicles is different from routing for traditional cars. Both EV's and internal combustion engines consume energy; however, the consumption of energy for battery-powered vehicles is impacted by a greater set of variables resulting in complex calculations based on vast sets of dynamic data. The introduction of electric mobility calls for a new approach to route optimization engines and navigation paradigms. 

## EV-specific routing
The range of an EV is impacted by situational variables such as topography, temperature, road conditions, and charge station availability. There are also different plug types, tariffs, and charge speeds to take into account. Mostly, people don't know where to charge, when to charge, how much it will cost, and how long the journey will take. Fast-charge stations can have long waiting times and offer little to do while you wait. This makes the 'charge and drive' experience problematic for new and potential drivers.

The Chargetrip API enables you to calculate EV specific routes for all Electric Vehicle brands and models. When calculating routes, our engine takes all the different situational variables into account that impact the range of the battery. Additionally, the API gives you detailed information on the different car models, stations, journey specs and more, to help you build intuitive EV driver front-ends.
